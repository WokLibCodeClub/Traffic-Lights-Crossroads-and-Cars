# Scratch project to control traffic flow with traffic lights

In this SCRATCH project you will program a set of traffic lights that will control the flow of cars at crossroads. This is a follow on from the *Traffic Lights* project completed by the Wokingham Library Online Code Club in November 2020. 

You can find details of that project, including links to Youtube videos of the sessions, at this link:
